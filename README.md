# QuickBites
This web application showcases a cloud kitchen website powered by the MERN stack. Users are presented with the option to easily select their preferred items, including pizzas, beverages, and more. They can click on any item to access detailed information such as pricing, available sizes, and customizable toppings. Users are also able to effortlessly add items to their shopping cart, where they have the flexibility to further customize their selections by choosing toppings and sizes.

## Features

- User-Friendly Design: Ensure an intuitive and responsive user interface.
- User Registration and Authentication: Implement user registration and login functionality to allow users to create accounts and track their orders.
- Menu Presentation: Organize the menu items into categories (e.g., pizzas, beverages, desserts).Include high-quality images, descriptions, prices, available sizes, and customizable options (toppings, sizes, etc.) for each item.
- Shopping Cart: Create a shopping cart system that allows users to add, update, and remove items easily.
- Mobile Responsiveness: Ensure the website is mobile-friendly, as many users will access it from smartphones and tablets.



## Import Data

This task involves fetching data from a JSON file that contains images and details of items on a website. After fetching the data, it should be filtered and presented to the user.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
